    content: `Imagine and pre-plan your "dream funeral," even if it's 50 years away, and tell your family what you want.

    Pre-planning your funeral arrangements can take some of the logistical and financial stresses off of your family after your death, and ensure that you get the kind of funeral you want. That said, don’t feel pressured to plan it down to the last detail. While some have no problem planning their own funeral, it’s understandable if you find it too difficult or overwhelming. However, you can still let your family know a few aspects to make it much smoother for everyone involved.
    
    The Biggest Decision You Should Make: Burial, Cremation Or Donation?
    First and foremost: Let your family and loved ones know if you want to be buried or cremated. Or you can put it in your Will or a letter to your family. Just let someone know your definitive answer to avoid any unnecessary stress during an already emotional time. If you don’t care, let them know that too.
    
    If you choose burial, you need to purchase a burial plot or a spot in a mausoleum at a cemetery. If you choose cremation, you can decide what you want done with the cremated remains, including burial, scattering, or giving them to friends and family members to be stored in an urn.

    Pre-Planning: Finding A Funeral Director
    Engage the services of a funeral home you trust and like and work with their funeral director to plan your burial or cremation and funeral or memorial service. The funeral director can also help you purchase any goods and services you’ll need for the burial, cremation, funeral, or memorial service.
    
    If you’re planning a funeral followed by burial, you will typically work with a funeral director at a funeral home. They will help you with all the arrangements, including working with a cemetery to purchase a plot and orchestrate the burial.
    
    If you are planning a funeral followed by cremation, you will typically work with a funeral director at a funeral home. They will help you connect with a crematory to arrange the cremation.
    
    If you are planning a direct cremation followed by a memorial service or ash scattering, you may be able to work with the crematory directly—you don’t have to work with a funeral home.
    
    How Are You Paying For It?
    When making pre-arrangements, it’s common to pre-pay for some or all of the products and services you’re organizing. There are a number of ways to pay for pre-arrangements, and some may meet your needs better than others. Pre-purchasing Goods And Services From A Funeral Home and Pre-paying With Funeral Insurance]
    
    Cemetery Arrangements
    You can work with a funeral home to find a cemetery or approach a cemetery directly and have a funeral direction coordinate the arrangements-How To Choose A Cemetery]. Here are a few things you need to consider:
    
    Find a cemetery: Location, religion, and environment are the big factors to consider when choosing a cemetery, as is vacancy (not just for the immediate burial, but for future family members as well).
    Decide if you want multiple plots: Are you buying plots for the future as well? If you are, you’ll want to find plots or mausoleum spaces that are together.
    Visit the cemetery: Take a look at the grounds: are they well maintained? Inspect the plot you’re buying: is it what you had in mind? Take this opportunity to ask any questions you might have before you sign the paperwork. Someone else can visit the cemetery on your behalf if you cannot visit yourself.
    A Quick Guide To Cremation and Burial Products
    Casket: Caskets come in a variety of styles and prices, and the selection of a casket is a personal choice. You can purchase a casket from the funeral home or from an online retailer.
    
    Burial Vault/Grave Liner: The cemetery will likely require a burial vault or grave liner, and the funeral home may have a limited selection of vaults and liners, so be aware that you may not have much of a choice for this product.
    
    Urn: Cremation urns come in a variety of styles and prices, and the selection of an urn is a personal choice.
    
    Cremation Casket: The selection of a cremation casket is a personal choice. You may purchase a casket for the funeral service that is then used for the cremation, though the casket should be made without metal as metal cannot be cremated. If you don’t want to buy a casket but you want to use one for the funeral service, you may rent one from the funeral home for the funeral service and use an alternative container for the cremation.
    
    Tip: Save all receipts for all funeral-related purchases. These expenses may be deductible on future tax returns.
    
    Before We Go Any Further...Have You Made Any Arrangements Already?
    It may seem strange to ask at this point, but have you made any previous arrangements? You’d probably remember. However, has someone already made these purchases on your behalf? Sometimes family members have plots set aside. Ask around to make sure. If someone did you the kindness of purchasing a plot share those details with your loved ones to avoid confusion and the purchase of another plot.
    
    What Type of Service Do You Want?
    Funerals, graveside services, and memorial services are the most common types, though you can also have a funeral service in your own home.
    
    There are also other events you may want, like wakes, viewings, and visitations. These are sometimes held before the service, and gatherings or receptions are often held after the service. Other things to consider:
    
    Choosing a location for the service
    Deciding who you would like to serve as pallbearers
    Selecting readings and songs you'd like to have performed at the service
    Personalize Your Funeral or Memorial Service
    You may consider identifying desired participants, readings, and even decorations if you wish. Other things to consider:
    
    Choose a location: Funerals are typically held at funeral homes, religious places of worship, chapels at cemeteries, or at gravesites.
    
    Choose an officiant: If you’ll be having the service at a religious place of worship, the religious leader there will likely lead the service. Otherwise, anyone you choose can lead the service.
    
    Choose participants: There are many ways for friends and family to participate in a funeral or memorial service. Identify who you’d like to serve as pallbearers and deliver eulogies and other readings. Participants may also sing songs, play music, or offer other tributes.
    
    Make a list of guests to invite: If there are specific people you would like to have invited to the service, write down their names and contact information so that the person managing the service will be sure to invite them.
    
    Design other elements of your funeral or memorial service: Let your family know how you’d like the service to look and feel. Choose flowers, music, and other personal touches.`

    title: '10 Things To Do After A Death',
    imageUrl: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516880354211-e5cc9b90d1ae?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1050&q=80",
    content: `It’s a difficult time, emotions are raw and there’s a lot to organize.

    1. Report the Death
    You must report a death to the proper authorities to begin the death certification process, which is jointly completed by a doctor or coroner and a funeral director. You’ll need multiple copies of the death certificate in order to do most of the tasks involved in disposition of the body, settling the estate, and wrapping up other affairs (like bank accounts and insurance).
    
    If you’re at a hospital, nursing home, or hospice, they will know what to do and can lead you through the proper steps, and will begin to complete the death certificate.
    If you’ve already been in touch with a funeral home, call them so they can get the process started.
    When you have no other options, call 911. Be aware that you’ll need a funeral director to claim the body for burial or cremation.
    If the person who died was an organ donor, inform the appropriate authorities so they can preserve the organs and prep them for donation.
    For Hospital and End-of-Life Facilities: Clean out the Deceased’s Residence
    If the person who died was living in a nursing home, assisted living facility, or hospice facility, there may be rules about how much time you have to remove the deceased’s personal property from his or her room. In order to avoid the potentially substantial charges that may result from insurance or Medicaid being discontinued.
    
    2. Prepare To Work With A Funeral Director
    You need to engage a funeral director to complete the death certificate and properly transport and store the remains. Most hospitals, nursing homes, and hospices require the removal of the body within a few hours after death.
    
    Two questions you’ll need to answer:
    Will the body be buried or cremated?
    What type of funeral service will you be having?
    If the person who died made funeral plans before death, work directly with the particular funeral home and be aware of any pre-payments so you don’t get double charged.
    
    Speaking of money… As soon as a bank is notified of the death, any of the deceased’s accounts will be frozen until processed in probate. If you’ve been using their cash to pay their expenses, you may want to withdraw money from their bank account while you still can.
    
    3. Types of Service: Funeral vs. Memorial vs. Graveside
    A funeral is when you have a service before the body is buried or cremated.
    
    A memorial service is when you have a service after the body has been buried or cremated.
    
    A graveside service is just like a funeral only it takes place on the gravesite.
    
    Regardless of the type of service, you’ll need to choose a location for the service (example: funeral home, church, synagogue, etc...) and, if appropriate, the burial (cemetery).
    
    What If The Death Occurs Far Away From Home?
    If the death occurred far away from where the burial will take place, you will need to work with a funeral director in the place the person died as well as a funeral director at the destination to make transportation arrangements.
    
    If you are planning a cremation followed by a memorial service at a later date, the body can be cremated in the city where the person died and the cremated remains can be shipped to you. If you are planning a cremation that will take place after a funeral service, you'll need to work with funeral homes to coordinate the transportation of the body.
    
    4. Make Cemetery Arrangements
    If you are planning a burial, you'll need to decide where the burial will take place. If the person who died didn’t make cemetery arrangements (i.e., pre-purchased a plot) you will need to purchase a cemetery plot or a space in a mausoleum.
    
    The funeral home you’re working with will likely be affiliated with one or more cemeteries, and they can help you find space in one. If you belong to a church, synagogue, or other religious group, they may be affiliated with a cemetery and can help connect you to the staff there, or facilitate the sale of a plot directly.
    
    5. Make Funeral Arrangements
    This is where the actual planning is a factor, for the funeral and any surrounding events for before or after the service.
    
    Choose the Type of Service You'll Have
    After you decide how you’re going to inter the body, you’ll need to decide if you want to have a ceremony around the interment—generally either a funeral (before the burial or cremation), a graveside service (at the interment), or memorial service (after the burial or cremation).
    
    Decide if You’ll Be Having Any Pre- or Post-Service Events
    Pre-funeral events generally include a viewing, wake, or visitation. Post-funeral events generally include receptions or gatherings. If you will be following religious traditions, those may help dictate these events. If you plan to have surrounding events, you will need to choose when and where they will take place.
    
    Choose How the Body will Be Prepared (i.e. Open Casket)
    Most funeral homes will require that a body be embalmed (a method of keeping the body in good condition) if there will be a viewing before the funeral or an open casket during the funeral.
    
    Some cultures and religions feel that being able to see the person who died offers a sense of closure, while some prohibit embalming and therefore effectively prohibit open-casket ceremonies.
    
    In some cases, depending on the cause of death, the cost and challenges of preparing the body to be viewed can be too great. While some funeral homes specialize in cosmetic restoration services, others may not have the resources to sufficiently prepare the body for viewing.
    
    You must also decide what clothing you want the person who died to be buried or cremated in, along with other belongings you want to have buried with the person.
    
    If the body will be cremated, keep in mind that any objects you'd like to save as keepsakes, such as jewelry or clothing, should be removed from the body prior to cremation.
    
    6. Choose Cremation or Burial Products
    If you're planning a burial, you'll need a casket and a burial vault or grave liner.
    
    If you're planning a cremation, you'll need a cremation casket and an urn.
    
    All of these products will be available at the funeral home or cremation service. If you’re looking to cut costs you can use online retailers.
    
    7. Choose Formal Transportation
    Transportation via hearse will be required to move the body from the funeral location to the cemetery, and the funeral home will provide and charge for this service. Transportation may be desired to get immediate family members from the funeral location to the cemetery in a funeral procession, and the funeral home can provide and will charge for this service, though you may also drive yourself.
    
    Note: If you're working with a funeral home, the funeral director should be taking care of these arrangements.
    
    8. Inform The Family and Write Death Notice
    Depending on the method of notification that you’ll be using, you may need access to the deceased’s address book or email account. As these calls can be emotionally difficult, it can be helpful to develop a script, or jot down talking points, so you make sure you provide all necessary information.
    
    Identify a point-person from each main social area of the deceased’s life (work, clubs, etc.) and ask that person to inform the other members of that group.
    
    To get the word out to a larger audience, a death notice is a paid announcement you place in a newspaper or on a website that notifies people of the death and any services that will be held. Checklist Writing A Death Notice or Obituary
    
    An obituary is an article written by a media outlet offering a biography of the person. Depending on the outlet, you usually have to lobby for coverage since it’s their call.
    
    ThinkAhead Free Service: Funeral Update allows you to create a free funeral website with a personalized URL to share information about the funeral and surrounding events, notify your family and friends of the details, and update everyone at once if anything changes.
    
    9. A Rundown of Possible Pre-Funeral Tasks
    Prepare Yourself: Figure out what you’ll wear to the funeral. If you need to purchase an outfit or have an outfit dry cleaned, these are tasks that someone else may be able to handle for you.
    
    Gather Personal Items: If a photograph or photographs of the person who died will be displayed at the service, collect those photos. If you will have a guestbook at the service, remember to bring the guestbook and pens.
    
    10. Personalize the Funeral or Memorial Service & Reception
    Choose an Officiant: If it’s taking place in a house of worship it will be a religious leader. It could also be a funeral director, or someone who has experience directing a funeral service.
    
    Choose Speakers and Write Eulogies: Be prepared that some people may decline a request to speak. Also be prepared for requests to speak from people you did not consider. It’s entirely acceptable to decline if you feel there are enough speakers or if it would be inappropriate for other reasons.
    
    Choose Pallbearers: If any people whom you would like to have as pallbearers are not physically capable of carrying the weight of a casket, those people can be made “honorary pallbearers” and can walk beside or behind the casket. [Learn More: Pallbearers]
    
    Choose Readings and/or Music: If you would like people to deliver specific readings or prayers, choose those readings. If you will have a singer, choir, or band/ensemble perform at the service, or if you will be playing music, choose the songs or music you would like to have performed.
    
    Create Programs: Funeral programs usually contain the order of the service (including the names of participants and any readings or musical pieces that are performed) as well as an obituary. If you’d like programs, the funeral home can do this for you as a cash advance.
    
    Purchase a Guestbook: Guestbooks allow the family to know who attended the funeral, and you may purchase one from the funeral home or from a stationery store. Guestbooks are usually placed at the entrance to the service venue.`

  content: `By figuring out the basics of what you want for your funeral or memorial service, you can more easily compare funeral homes and directors, go into your first meeting with a funeral director armed with information about your choices, and be empowered to make the best decisions.

  Whether you decide to pay in advance for some or all of your funeral, or if you make arrangements without purchasing anything, there are some important decisions you should consider before beginning the planning process. Below are many questions to consider. While you don’t have to answer all of these questions before you meet with a funeral director, having a sense of what you want can certainly help.
  
  Disposition
  Would you like to be buried or cremated?
  Service
  What would you like your funeral service to be like?
  Would you like the body to be present at the service or not? If you want the body to be present, would you like the casket to be open or closed?
  Where would you like the service to be held?
  Who would you like to officiate the service?
  Interment
  Would you like to be buried in the ground in a cemetery? If so, do you have a cemetery in mind?
  Would you like to be buried in the ground in another location? If so, do you have another location in mind?
  Would you like to be interred in a crypt, mausoleum, or columbarium?
  If you’re planning a cremation, would you like your ashes to be scattered or kept by family members? If scattered, where?
  Products
  If you’re planning a burial, what style of casket would you like?
  If you’re planning a cremation, what style of urn would you like?
  If your remains will be buried, what style of headstone or marker would you like? What would you like it to say?
  Financing
  Will you pay all funeral costs up front?
  Will you work with the funeral home to create a payment plan?
  Will you set aside money for your children to pay the costs when the time comes?
  Communicating With Your Family
  One of the keys to effective funeral planning is open communication. Letting your family know what you want in terms of burial or cremation and the type of service you want to have can help get everyone on the same page, and can help with making arrangements when the time comes. 
  
  These conversations can be difficult. It can be hard to talk to your children or your partner about your wishes and your mortality; it can be hard to talk to parents about their wishes and their mortality. Keeping the conversation centered on practical planning—where you'd like to be buried, or where you'd like your ashes to be scattered—can potentially help reduce conflict and emotionally charged disagreements.
  
  It's also important to remember that not everyone in your family will agree with your decisions. While it's important to try and get everyone on the same page, if you are making plans for yourself then you have every right to make whatever decisions you'd like.
  
  Once you've had a chance to think about the type of arrangements you'd like to make, you'll be ready to begin the process of choosing a funeral home to work with.`

  content: `In some situations the party responsible for making decisions about the funeral can be unclear and even contested.

  A funeral requires a lot of important decisions, some of which are...
  
  Whether or bury or cremate the deceased
  Whether to hold a traditional funeral service or a memorial service
  Whether to follow any religious traditions
  Where the interment or service should take place
  What happens when you add family drama to mix? In cases of cultural intermarriage, religious difference, geographic distance, or family division as a result of divorce or disagreement, it can get very messy. Here's some advice on how to navigate these dangerous waters.
  
  If The Person Who Died Made Instructions
  If the deceased designated someone to make choices regarding their disposition, that preference must be honored. This designation may have been made in a Last Will and Testament, a Living Will, or another notarized or otherwise legal document, such as...
  
  Authorization for Final Disposition
  Disposition Authorization Affidavit
  Appointment of Agent to Control Disposition of Remains
  If The Person Who Died Didn't Make Instructions
  If the deceased didn't make any preferences legally known, then the decision falls to the next-of-kin (nearest relative). If the next of kin is unavailable or unable to make decisions of this nature, the next of kin hierarchy is followed until someone who is able to make these decisions can be found.
  
  In certain situations, such as an accident or disaster in which the next of kin was injured as well, the person with the right to control disposition might be temporarily incapable of making arrangements. In these cases, the degree of incapacity will have to be determined, usually by the doctor overseeing care for the next of kin.
  
  In some states, the next of kin who will be making arrangements will need to fill out a form asserting that they have the legal right to control the disposition of remains. This form goes by different names, but is sometimes called an "At-Need Written Statement of Person Having the Right to Control Disposition" or an "Affidavit or Authorization to Control Disposition."
  
  Next Of Kin Hierarchy
  In order to qualify as next of kin in this situation, a person must be over 18-years-old. The relationships listed below usually apply to biological, adoptive, half-, and step-relations equally.
  
  Spouse/domestic partner
  Children 
  Parents
  Siblings
  Authorized guardian
  Grandchildren
  Great-grandchildren
  Nieces and nephews
  Grand-nieces and grand-nephews
  Grandparents
  Aunts and uncles
  First cousins
  Great-grandchildren of Grandparents
  Second cousins
  Fiduciary (a legally appointed trustee) 
  In some states, a close friend who is familiar with the deceased’s wishes may qualify as next of kin if no one on the above list is available or able.
  
  If The Next Of Kin Is Contested
  If the next of kin is incapable of making arrangements, it's legally appropriate to follow the next of kin hierarchy to determine who has the right to control disposition and make arrangements. However, in cases in which the next of kin may only be temporarily incapacitated, it may be fair to wait until the next of kin becomes capable. In these situations it can be helpful to consider what the (temporarily incapable) next of kin would want or what the person who died would have wanted.
  
  Especially in cases where there are disputes over cultural, religious, or geographic differences, coming to an agreement about who has the right to control disposition can be challenging. To make the decision that's best for your family, it may be helpful to try and put personal preferences aside and consider what the deceased would have wanted, or who the deceased would want making the final funeral decisions.

  content:`Green funeral homes make environmentally friendly goods available to their customers, offer non-toxic body preparation options, and work with green cemeteries or natural burial grounds.

  What Makes A Funeral Home "Green"?
  Green funeral homes are defined by their willingness to comply with green standards (as set forth by the Green Burial Council), including:
  
  Making environmentally friendly body storage/preservation available
  Offering to hold a public viewing without embalming
  Offering embalming using non-toxic, non-formaldehyde embalming solutions
  Offering multiple burial containers made from biodegradable or plant-based materials ("green caskets")
  How Do I Know If A Funeral Home Is "Green" Or Not?
  Ideally, the funeral home will identify itself and its products and services as “green” and have on staff at least one person who has participated in Green Burial Council-approved educational training. However, it is possible to hold a green funeral with a funeral home that does not advertise itself as green but does make green options available to consumers. If you're not sure if the funeral home you're working with is "green" or not, you should ask the funeral director there, and he or she should be able to give you a clear answer.
  
  Can I Have A Green Funeral Without Using A Green Funeral Home?
  There are varying degrees of "green" in green funeral planning. You can opt to have the body refrigerated rather than embalmed, you can choose a green casket instead of a conventional casket, you can bury the body in a green cemetery or natural burial ground, or you can opt to cremate the body—all of which are environmentally friendly things to do.
  
  How Do I Find A Green Funeral Home?
