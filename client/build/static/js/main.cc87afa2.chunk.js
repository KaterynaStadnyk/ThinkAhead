If you are a financial advisor accessing the Services on behalf of your customer or another entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to (i) add, create, upload, submit, distribute or post any and all Content to the Services on such customer or entity\u2019s behalf and (ii) bind such customer or entity to the licenses set forth in this Section 3.

Secure Information.  \u201cSecure Information\u201d means your private, sensitive, personal information that you privately submit through the Services, including your health and medical information, financial information, and legal information. Some of such health and health related information may be considered \u201cProtected Health Information\u201d or \u201cPHI,\u201d as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d). By submitting Secure Information through the Services, you hereby do and shall grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, store, reproduce and display your Secure Information solely as reasonably necessary to operate the Services solely on your behalf, and subject to these Terms and our Privacy Policy located at https://www.thinkahead.com/privacy-policy. You (and your Co-Administrator, if applicable) always retain ownership of your Secure Information. We take the privacy and security of your Secure Information very seriously, and have built in privacy and security measures into our technology and our business practices. In addition, we shall handle your Secure Information in accordance with our obligations under HIPAA as a HIPAA-compliant company. Only you -- or a Co-Administrator (if applicable) -- can give permission to share any of your Secure Information with a Read Or Write Access Deputy. Since your Secure Information and all files are encrypted, in the course of our standard daily business operations we can only see the types of Secure Information users submit through the Services on a categorical basis, but not the content or details of such Secure Information. The only time we may have access to or disclose the content or details of your Secure Information is when you or a Co-Administrator (if applicable) has given the requisite permission to share such Secure Information with a Read or Write Access Deputy as further described herein, when we are required to by Law, or in other rare circumstances as described in our Privacy Policy https://www.thinkahead.com/privacy-policy. We will store your Secure Information and share it only with the Read Or Write Access Deputies you or your Co-Administrator choose or as required by Law. While we can see which portions of the ThinkAhead you have filled out with your Secure Information, we do not in the course of normal operations see what your Secure Information actually says. We work hard to keep your Secure Information private and protected.  It is important that you read our Privacy Policy https://www.thinkahead.com/privacy-policy, so please do so. iii. Funeral Information.  \u201cFuneral Information\u201d means the information you post, upload or otherwise submit through the Services when using the \u201cFuneral Update\u201d feature that you would like to be used to inform people of the particulars of the funeral.

You also hereby do and shall grant each user of the Services a non-exclusive, perpetual license to access your Funeral Information through the Services, and to use, edit, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform such Funeral Information, including after termination of your Account or the Services.  We do not guarantee the privacy or confidentiality of any Funeral Information, so please do not publicly post or submit any Content on a Funeral Update page that you do not want to be publicly accessible or viewable.  You hereby acknowledge that any Funeral Information you submit through the Services may be indexed by a search engine operator (like Google) and found in search results. In other words: Funeral Information may be publicly accessible and searchable, so please be mindful when posting it using the Funeral Update feature. iv. Use Information.  If you are working with (a) a financial advisor or (b) an employer, benefits administrator, insurance company or any third party institution (this subsection (b) collectively, a \u201cPartner Provider\u201d) to provide you (and, if applicable, a Co-Administrator) access to the Premium Services (as defined below), your financial advisor or Partner Provider (as applicable) may be able to see certain high-level information about your use of and access to the Services, which may include the type of Everplan you signed up for, the date and time of your last login to the Services, your total number of logins to the Services, and which sections of your Everplan you completed (collectively, the \u201cUse Information\u201d). By accepting a financial advisor\u2019s or Partner Provider\u2019s invitation to sign up for the Premium Services, (an \u201cInvitation\u201d), you hereby do and shall grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and transferable license to use, store, aggregate, reproduce, transmit and display Use Information, internally or to your financial advisor or Partner Provider (if applicable), solely as necessary to operate, provide and improve the Site, the Services (including without limitation the Premium Services) and our (and our successors\u2019 and assigns\u2019) businesses, including after termination of your Account or the Services. You also hereby do and shall grant your financial advisor or Partner Provider, as applicable, a non-exclusive, perpetual license to access your Use Information through the Services, and to use, prepare derivative works of, and display such Use Information, including after termination of your Account or the Services. To be clear, Use Information may be personally identifiable and may be tied back to you (and, if applicable, your Co-Administrator), your Account and/or your web browser. In other words, if you receive an ThinkAhead from a financial advisor or a Partner Provider, we may surface information on your use of the services back to that advisor or Partner Provider (as applicable), but never the contents of your ThinkAhead or your Secure Information unless you have designated them as a Read or Write Access Deputy for the particular Secure Information you have chosen to share. vi.

You also hereby do and shall grant each user of the Services a non-exclusive, perpetual license to access your Public Information through the Services, and to use, edit, modify, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform such Public Information, including after your termination of your Account or the Services.  Please do not publicly post or submit any Content that you do not want publicly accessible or viewable. In other words:  Public Information is public, so don\u2019t include any private or sensitive information in it. vii.

If your credit card reaches its expiration date, we may attempt to contact you to update your payment information using your primary email address associated with your Account.  You agree to promptly notify us and your credit card company if your credit card is canceled (e.g., for loss or theft) or if you become aware of potential breach of security.  You agree that we (via Stripe) may continue charging your credit card for the Premium Services unless you have terminated your access to the Premium Services or you tell us to use a different credit card before the end of the applicable billing period.

You will continue to be billed for your use of and access to the Premium Services unless and until you cancel it or we terminate it.  You must cancel your use of and access to the Premium Services before the start of a new renewal period to avoid having the next period\u2019s fees billed to your credit card.  Again, please note that any charges submitted to or processed by Stripe before we could reasonably act in response to such cancellation will not be affected.  ThinkAhead will not issue a refund for the most recently (or any previously) charged fees associated with the Premium Services prior to any such cancellation.  All provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including without limitation, any licenses to Basic Information, Funeral Information, Public Information, or Aggregate Information, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitation of liability. In other words: Cancellation is effective immediately, but does not affect charges already incurred.  Parts of this agreement still apply to you even after you cancel your Account. 9. Warranty Disclaimer We have no special relationship or fiduciary duty to you. You release us from all liability for any release of Your Information, including without limitation your Secure Information, including without limitation any sections of your Secure Information marked as only available for release after you are declared dead (the \u201cAfter Death Sections\u201d) pursuant to our (a) receipt from you of any instructions or permissions authorizing such release to any other person, including without limitation any Read Or Write Access Deputy or (b) compliance with any Laws.

We don\u2019t anticipate shutting down, but in case we do, we want you to be able to get Your Information. 15. Miscellaneous a. Entire Agreement.  These Terms and all other ThinkAhead agreements and policies expressly incorporated by reference, each as may be amended or modified by ThinkAhead in accordance with its terms from time to time, together constitute the entire agreement between you and us and govern your use of the Services, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and agreements of any kind between you and us with respect to the Services.  If any incorporated agreements or policies conflict with these Terms, these Terms shall control. b. Section Headings and \u201cIn Other Words.\u201d  The section headings and \u201cin other words\u201d mini-paragraphs are for convenience only, shall not affect their interpretation, and shall have no legal or contractual effect.  If the terms and conditions of these Terms and the section headings and \u201cin other words\u201d mini-paragraphs conflict, the terms and conditions of these Terms shall prevail. In other words: We tried to make this as simple as possible, but the section headings and \u201cin other words\u201d mini-paragraphs are not actually part of the agreement.  You have to read the full Terms. c. Force Majeure.  We shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations under these Terms where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including without limitation mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation. d. Waiver and Severability.  Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms.  Waiver of compliance in any particular instances does not mean that we will waive compliance in the future.  In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives.  If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. In other words:  The only valid way for us to waive your compliance with any of this agreement is by written notice from us.  If any part of this agreement is found to be invalid, the rest still stands. e. Assignment.  These Terms are personal to you, and you may not assign, transfer or sublicense any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without ThinkAhead\u2019 express prior written consent.

ThinkAhead may also suspend or terminate your Account if you violate these Terms.  We may attempt to notify you before suspending or terminating your Account so that you can export or delete your Secure Information, but we reserve the right to immediately suspend or terminate your Account in certain circumstances, such as causing harm to another user, disrupting other users\u2019 use of the Services, or causing ThinkAhead potential legal liability. h.
