          I'm sure that every person alive at some point has thought about their
          own funeral. Mabye you have ideas concerning what music to play, the
          people who should attend or what images to display. The question is,
          how should the people you hold dear know about your final wishes when
          youÂ´re gone? With Think Ahead all this important information is safely
          stored in one place and can be shared with someone you trust.
        </p>

        <Articles />
        <BottomNavbar />
