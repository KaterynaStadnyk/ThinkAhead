      <p>My grandma is very stubborn and likes to have it her way. Before she turned 90 she decided to arrange her own combined funeral/birthday party and invited her family and friends. This did not only make it possible for her to attend her own ”funeral” but she also had total control of the event, from what food to eat to what music to play. This inspired me and made me think of how I would arrange my own funeral.  What I missed was a platform where I could collect all the vital information and share it to the people closest to me. So our wonderful team at Ironhack decided to create an app that enables you to do exactly that. Think Ahead makes planning your funeral as lighthearted and simple as possible.</p>
